* which key
For me which key used to be indispensable, now I disable it. But you do you. I have it enabled by default because I hope it will be helpful. If not just comment it out.
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package which-key
  :straight t
  :hook (emacs-startup . (lambda ()
			   (which-key-mode))))
#+end_src
** posframe
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package which-key-posframe
    :straight t
    :init (which-key-posframe-mode 1))
#+end_src
